# Microverse HTML, CSS, JS Capstone Project
Asian Youth Program (AYP), in partnership with Womankind (formerly New York Asian Women’s Center), offers mentoring to children impacted by domestic violence. AYP mentors become positive role models engaging in one-to-one relationships through enrichment activities and recreational trips to cultural sites around New York City. All activities are designed to build self-confidence, foster a sense of family and community, and inspire a commitment to service among the children served in a fun and nurturing environment.
The website content is fictional. It was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet the requirements defined within the scope of the Microverse Capstone project. In particular, I would like to point out that I built this website completely from scratch.
